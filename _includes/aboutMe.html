As I learn more about programming, the more I feel the need to learn more. In my younger days, I was a ski tech at a local ski hill. I think here is where I began my thirst to learn and perfect what I was doing. While there I would look-up different ways to wax and sharpen skis, different ways to fix various delaminations, and the best way to mount the equipment for every user type. To find out what the best would be for the user you would need to learn how to "interview" the customer, a technique that became priceless. In this "interview" I would try and get the feel of the person and try and figure out what they would really want and then I would suggest what I thought and ask how they felt about it.
